# CWE-209: Information Exposure Through an Error Message
VerademoGO calls log::Println() throughout it's code, which exposes information about the application logic or other info such as names and entries. This information can become useful to an attacker as they can learn about where to attack the application with the info they get to the console. 

# Remediate 
* Ensure only error messages are being returned to the console
