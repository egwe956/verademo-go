# CWE-117: Improper Output Neutralization for Logs
VerademoGO makes calls to log::Println(), which prints data to the console. This could result in a log forging attack since it's writing untrusted data into a log file, which allows attackers to forge the log entries or inject any content they wish into those log files.

# Mitigate
* Validate entries don't contain any CR or LF Characters

# Remediate
* Avoid directly embedding input data in log files. Instead sanitize the untrusted data to construct the log entries
